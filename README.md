#Basic CRUD operations with JWt authentication.
#gettoken - to get the JWT token
#getbooks - to get the list of books from Object
#getbook/:id - to get the book detials using id from Object
#addbook - to add a new book object into the existing object
#updatebook/:id - to update book details in existing book object
#/deletebook/:id - to delete a book from an existing object

The code still needs improvement, as it is currently at a basic level with JWT token. For every request, except for 'gettoken,' a JWT token must be sent for authentication.
